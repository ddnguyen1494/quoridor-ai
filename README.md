##Project Title

QUORIDOR AI

##Description

[Quoridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor) is a board game with 81 squares (9x9). The objective of the game is to get your pawn from the starting position to the other end of the board first. Players on their turn may choose to move one space, horizontally or vertically, or they may place a wall on the board that blocks 2 square spaces on the board. Walls cannot be placed so they block the only route a player has to reach the other side. There are many different strategies to the game which can be interesting to watch or figure out.
